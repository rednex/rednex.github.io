Redirections from the old RGBDS docs to the new ones

Since the RGBDS repo was transferred from rednex/rgbds to [gbdev/rgbds](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds) (see [issue #567](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/issues/567)), the docs moved from rednex.github.io/rgbds/* to [rgbds.gbdev.io/docs](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs) ([source code](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds-www/tree/master/_documentation)). The redirections in this repo are there to ensure that the old pages don't become 404s.

In general, Rednex as an organization has been merged into [gbdev](https://github.com/gbdev), so please open issues etc. there. Thank you!
